EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Based on extensive industry research, I've created an optimized Google Ads strategy specifically for your air duct and chimney services in Orlando. This strategy focuses on generating high-quality phone calls from customers ready to book high-ticket services. Key Findings:
Expected Cost Per Lead: $70-$75 (industry benchmark)
Expected CPC: $7-$12 for air duct cleaning, $8-$15 for chimney services
Average ticket value: $400-$1,000 for air duct, $250-$500+ for chimney
Best channel mix: Local Services Ads (LSA) + Search Ads
SECTION 1: COST BENCHMARKS & EXPECTATIONS
Industry Benchmarks (2025)
Air Duct Cleaning:
Median CPL: $73.70
Low CPL (10th percentile): $51.00

Your Target KPIs
Based on research, here are realistic targets:
Target CPL: $60-$80 (start conservatively at $75-$80)
Target CPC: $8-$12
Minimum call length: 60 seconds (filters spam)
Target close rate: 25-35% (industry average for home services)
Daily budget recommendation: Start with $50-$100/day
SECTION 2: CAMPAIGN STRATEGY OVERVIEW
Recommended Channel Mix
Priority 1: Google Local Services Ads (LSA) - IF ELIGIBLE
Pay-per-lead (not per-click) = better ROI
Average LSA cost: $60-$90 per lead for HVAC-related services
Higher intent leads (people ready to hire)
Requires: Google Guarantee screening, licensing verification
Priority 2: Google Search Ads (Our primary focus for this setup)
More control over targeting, keywords, and messaging
Scales better than LSA alone
Best for capturing urgent "problem + need solution now" searches
Avoid (For Now): Performance Max
Wait until you have solid conversion data
Requires 6+ weeks of learning period
Better as a scaling tool after core campaigns work

SECTION 7: BIDDING STRATEGY EVOLUTION
Phase 1: Launch (Weeks 1-3)
Strategy: Manual CPC Starting Bid: $8-$10 Why: Build data, test keywords, find what works Actions:
Monitor search terms daily
Add negative keywords 3x/week
Adjust bids by keyword performance
Test ad copy variations
Success Criteria: 30-50 conversions (calls)
Phase 2: Scale (Weeks 4-8)
Strategy: Maximize Conversions (no target) Why: Let Google optimize for call volume Actions:
Increase budget by 20% per week if CPL is good
Let algorithm learn (minimize changes)
Add new keyword themes based on search terms
Expand to Search Partners if Search is profitable
Success Criteria: Stable CPL under $85, 10+ calls/week
Phase 3: Optimize (Weeks 9+)
Strategy: Maximize Conversions with Target CPA Target CPA: Set at your actual CPA + 10% Why: Stabilize costs while maintaining volume Actions:
Import "booked appointments" from CRM
Optimize to booked calls (not just all calls)
Gradually lower Target CPA by 5% every 2 weeks
Test value-based bidding if revenue data available
Success Criteria: 30%+ close rate, positive ROI
SECTION 8: QUALITY SCORE OPTIMIZATION
Quality Score = Lower CPCs. Here's how to improve it:
1. Expected CTR (Click-Through Rate)
How to Improve:
Add location to headlines ("Orlando")
Include phone number in headline
Use urgent language ("Same-Day", "24/7")
Add emotional triggers ("Safe", "Protect Your Family")
Pin strongest headlines to position 1
2. Ad Relevance
How to Improve:
Match ad copy to keyword theme
Air duct keywords → Air duct ad
Chimney keywords → Chimney ad
Use exact service names from search query
Tighten ad groups (don't mix services)
3. Landing Page Experience
How to Improve:
Fast load time (already good ✓)
Mobile-friendly (already good ✓)
Clear CTA above fold (already good ✓)
Service mentioned in URL (/orlando ✓)
Add trust signals (reviews, badges)
Reduce form fields (current form is good)
Your Current Quality Score Target: 7-9/10
SECTION 9: BUDGET PLANNING
Recommended Starting Budget
Month 1:
Air Duct Cleaning: $50/day = $1,500/month
Chimney Services: $30/day = $900/month
Total: $80/day = $2,400/month
Expected Results Month 1:
Clicks: 240-300
Calls: 30-35
CPL: $70-$85 (higher while learning)
Booked appointments: 10-12 (assuming 30% close rate)
Revenue: $4,000-$10,000 (depending on service mix)
Scaling Plan
Month 2: If Month 1 ROI > 2:1
Increase budget to $120/day
Add Search Partners network
Test broad match keywords
Expected calls: 50-60/month
Month 3: If still profitable
Increase to $150-$200/day
Add Emergency campaign
Launch Local Services Ads (if eligible)
Expand to nearby cities (Winter Park, Kissimmee)
Expected calls: 70-90/month
Break-Even Analysis
Example Scenario:
Average ticket: $600
Gross margin: 60% = $360 profit per job
Close rate: 30%
Max CPL to break even: $360 × 30% = $108
Your target CPL of $70-$80 gives you 35-54% profit margin.

Lower bids on keywords with CPL > $100
Raise bids on keywords with CPL < $60 (if limited by budget)
Pause keywords with 0 conversions after $150 spend

Check Ad Strength (should be "Excellent")
Swap out underperforming headlines

SECTION 11: RED FLAGS & TROUBLESHOOTING
Warning Signs Something is Wrong
Problem	Likely Cause	Fix
High clicks, no calls	Wrong traffic or bad landing page	Check search terms, add negatives
High CPL (>$120)	Wrong bidding or low Quality Score	Lower bids, improve ads/landing page
Low impressions	Bids too low or poor Ad Rank	Increase bids, improve Quality Score
High CPC (>$20)	Too competitive keywords	Add more specific long-tail keywords
Calls but no bookings	Wrong type of leads	Check call quality, update ad copy to pre-qualify
Dropping CTR	Ad fatigue or competition	Refresh ad copy, test new headlines
Learning phase stuck	Not enough conversions	Increase budget or lower Target CPA
Common Mistakes to Avoid
Making too many changes too fast: Let campaigns run 7 days before major changes
Not tracking offline conversions: You're optimizing for "any call" not "booked job"
Ignoring mobile: 70%+ of searches are mobile - test mobile landing page
Pausing campaigns on weekends: Calls may be lower but CPL is often better
Not answering calls: If calls go to voicemail, you're wasting ad spend
Setting Target CPA too low: Google will stop showing ads if target is unrealistic
Mixing services in one ad group: Keep air duct and chimney separate
Forgetting about brand terms: Bid on your own company name (cheap clicks)

FINAL SUMMARY: YOUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
Based on my research, here's why your campaign will succeed:
1. Excellent Landing Page
Your Orlando page is already well-optimized (fast, clear CTA, local focus). Most competitors have poor landing pages.
2. Focused Local Targeting
You're starting with one city (Orlando), which lets you:
Build local expertise
Create city-specific ad copy
Build reviews in one area
Lower CPCs (less broad targeting)
3. Multiple Services = Higher Lifetime Value
You offer air duct + chimney + dryer vent + repairs. Most competitors specialize in one. This gives you:
Higher customer lifetime value
More keyword opportunities
Cross-sell opportunities
4. Same-Day + 24/7 Service
This is a HUGE competitive advantage in Google Ads. Urgency sells.
5. Florida Specialization
Your messaging mentions humidity, mold prevention, and Florida-specific challenges. This builds trust.
IMPORTANT REMINDERS
Answer Your Phone: 50% of ad waste is unanswered calls. Answer live or use answering service.
Track Everything: You can't improve what you don't measure. Set up tracking BEFORE launching.
Be Patient: Google Ads takes 4-6 weeks to optimize. Don't panic if Week 1 CPL is high.
Start Small, Scale Fast: Better to start with $80/day and scale up than blow $500/day with poor setup.
Reviews Win: Get 10+ Google reviews in first 60 days. They affect Quality Score and LSA ranking.
Test & Learn: Marketing is iterative. What works in Los Angeles may not work in Orlando. Test everything.
