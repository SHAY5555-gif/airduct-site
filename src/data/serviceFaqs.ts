    question: "How much does air duct cleaning cost in Southern California?",
    answer: "Most single-system homes in Southern California typically pay $300-$700 for a full HVAC duct cleaning, depending on home size, vent count, duct type, and accessibility. Larger homes or systems with heavy buildup may cost $800 or more. We provide free estimates with no hidden fees."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I clean my air ducts?",
    answer: "For most homes, we recommend cleaning air ducts every 3-5 years. However, you may need more frequent cleaning if you have pets, allergies, smokers in the home, recent renovations, or notice excessive dust or musty odors. The EPA recommends cleaning as needed when there's visible contamination."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does air duct cleaning take?",
    answer: "A typical residential air duct cleaning takes 2-4 hours, depending on the size of your home, number of vents, and duct condition. Two-system homes often take 4-6 hours. We'll give you an accurate time estimate after inspecting your system."
  },
  {
    question: "What is included in your air duct cleaning service?",
    answer: "Our whole-system cleaning includes: supply and return trunk lines, all branch runs, vent and register cleaning, air handler and blower compartment cleaning, before and after photos, and a final system inspection. We use HEPA-filtered vacuum equipment for safe, thorough cleaning."
  },
  {
    question: "Can air duct cleaning help with allergies?",
    answer: "Air duct cleaning can help reduce allergy symptoms when there's significant dust, pet dander, pollen, or debris in your ducts. However, for best results, we recommend combining duct cleaning with quality air filters (MERV-rated), proper humidity control, and regular HVAC maintenance."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide before and after photos?",
    answer: "Yes, we document every job with time-stamped before and after photos showing the condition of your main trunk lines, return drops, and key components. This ensures transparency and lets you see exactly what we cleaned and the results achieved."
  },
  {
    question: "Can dirty air ducts affect my energy bills?",
    answer: "Yes, when ducts are clogged with debris or the blower compartment is dirty, your HVAC system works harder and uses more energy. Clean ducts allow better airflow and can improve system efficiency. We recommend combining duct cleaning with a full system inspection for best results."
  },
  {
    question: "What signs indicate I need air duct cleaning?",
    answer: "Common signs include: visible dust blowing from vents, musty or stale odors when the system runs, increased allergy symptoms indoors, visible mold or debris around vents, recent home renovation or construction, pest infestation history, or it's been more than 5 years since your last cleaning."

export const dryerVentCleaningFaqs: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "How do I know if my dryer vent is clogged?",
    answer: "Warning signs include: clothes taking longer than one cycle to dry, the dryer feeling very hot to the touch, a burning smell when running, excessive lint around the dryer or on clothing, the vent hood flap not opening properly, and increased humidity in the laundry area."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I clean my dryer vent?",
    answer: "We recommend professional dryer vent cleaning at least once per year. Households with heavy laundry use, longer vent runs, or multiple family members may need cleaning every 6-9 months. Regular cleaning prevents fire hazards and keeps your dryer running efficiently."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does dryer vent cleaning cost?",
    answer: "Dryer vent cleaning typically costs $89-$179 depending on vent length, accessibility, and whether it terminates through the roof or wall. We provide upfront pricing with no hidden fees. Many customers combine this service with air duct cleaning for added savings."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is dryer vent cleaning important for fire safety?",
    answer: "Clogged dryer vents are a leading cause of house fires, causing approximately 15,000 fires annually in the US. Lint is highly flammable, and when combined with the dryer's heat, it creates a serious fire hazard. Regular cleaning dramatically reduces this risk."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does dryer vent cleaning take?",
    answer: "Most dryer vent cleanings take 30-60 minutes for standard runs. Longer vents or roof-terminated vents may take 60-90 minutes. We clean the full run from the dryer connection to the exterior termination and verify proper airflow when finished."
  },
  {
    question: "Will dryer vent cleaning help my clothes dry faster?",
    answer: "Yes, most customers notice immediately faster drying times after cleaning. A clogged vent restricts airflow, making your dryer work harder and longer. Clean vents restore proper airflow, reducing drying time and extending the life of your dryer and clothes."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you clean rigid and flexible dryer vents?",
    answer: "Yes, we clean all types of dryer vents including rigid metal, semi-rigid, and flexible ducts. We also clean vents that terminate through walls, roofs, or soffits. If your current vent material is causing issues, we can recommend upgrades."

  },
  {
    question: "Should I repair or replace my air ducts?",

  },
  {
    question: "Can leaky ducts increase my energy bills?",
    answer: "Yes, the EPA estimates that leaky ducts can reduce HVAC efficiency by 20-40%. Conditioned air escapes into unconditioned spaces like attics or crawlspaces, forcing your system to work harder. Proper duct sealing can significantly reduce energy costs."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does duct repair take?",

  },
  {
    question: "What is creosote and why is it dangerous?",

  },
  {
    question: "What should I do before the chimney sweep arrives?",
    answer: "Clear the area around your fireplace of furniture and decorations. Ensure the fire has been out for at least 24 hours and the ashes are cool. We bring drop cloths and vacuum equipment to protect your home, but clearing the area helps us work efficiently."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I clean my chimney myself?",
    answer: "While DIY chimney cleaning is possible, professional cleaning is recommended for safety and thoroughness.

  },
  {
    question: "What is tuckpointing and when is it needed?",
    answer: "Tuckpointing is the process of removing deteriorated mortar and replacing it with new mortar. It's needed when mortar joints are crumbling, cracked, or recessed more than 1/4 inch. Proper tuckpointing prevents water damage and extends your chimney's life by decades."
  },
  {
    question: "Can chimney damage cause water leaks?",
    answer: "Yes, chimney problems are a common source of water leaks. Damaged crowns, cracked flashing, missing caps, and deteriorated mortar all allow water to enter. Water damage can affect not just the chimney but also ceilings, walls, and the home's structure if left untreated."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it safe to use my fireplace if my chimney needs repair?",
    answer: "It depends on the type of damage. Minor cosmetic issues may not affect safety, but structural damage, flue liner cracks, or significant mortar deterioration can create fire and carbon monoxide hazards. We recommend a professional inspection before using a questionable chimney."
